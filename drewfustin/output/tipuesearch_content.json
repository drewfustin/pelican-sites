{"pages":[{"title":"The Physics of Deflategate","text":"Fine. You win, NFL. After becoming an obsessive fan in 1993 when the Patriots drafted Drew Bledsoe, because we had the same name (which, to my 11 year old brain, made a ton of sense), I've followed your league closer than any reasonable person would. I've lived through the heartache of Bill Parcells leaving (and absconding to the Jets with Curtis Martin) to the pains experienced after Drew Bledsoe's tragic (and fateful) injury to living through Pete Carroll. I've experienced the highs of an inexplicable Super Bowl run in Brady's first year as a starter and a nearly perfect season, and the heartache of 18-1. I'm even more obsessed with the NFL Draft than basically anyone I know. But, you win. I'm out. I'm done with the NFL. But not without one last football-related rant. After the overblown story that was Spygate , I now have to endure Deflategate -- a scandal so absurd that you don't even try to hide that it's only a scandal if the Patriots do it . Why is it absurd, you ask? Come on, everyone knows it's absurd. So, just allow me to focus only on the absurdity that I have an expertise in -- the physics. I hate people who credential drop. I really do. But, in this case it's justified. I am not some idiot NFL fan who blindly believes anything my team tells me. I have a Ph.D. in Physics from the number 12 institution in the world . My dissertation even dealt heavily with all things pressure -- it specifically mentions psi 143 times. And my expertise (not my fandom) claims that this assertion that the Wells Report makes is the height of absurdity: According to our scientific consultants, however, the reduction in pressure of the Patriots game balls cannot be explained completely by basic scientific principles, such as the Ideal Gas Law, based on the circumstances and conditions likely to have been present on the day of the AFC Championship Game. (Your scientific consultants, by the way, think secondhand smoke does not cause cancer . And what happened to partnering with Columbia University's physics department ? Did they not agree to your assumptions?) It's absurd because they ultimately make the claim that the reduction in pressure of the Patriots game balls is beyond the reach of the Ideal Gas Law because the reduction had to be the bigger of the two available answers despite the fact that it probably wasn't. That sentence sounds silly and circular, and that's because it is. But, it's what the report says. You see, as we all know by now, there were two pressure gauges of the same precision but with different accuracy available to the NFL officials during halftime measurements -- the so-called \"Logo Gauge\" and the \"Non-Logo Gauge.\" The Logo Gauge tended to give results that were about 0.35 psig 1 higher than the Non-Logo Gauge. To compare the halftime pressure readings to the pre-game pressure readings, we need to know which gauge Walt Anderson used for the pre-game pressure readings. On page 52 of this infernal report, it says: Although Anderson's best recollection is that he used the Logo Gauge, he said that it is certainly possible that he used the Non-Logo Gauge. They then go on assuming he used the Non-Logo Gauge. Why? Here, again, is the infernal report: Exponent's experimental results were aligned with the measurements recorded at halftime, which indicated a consistent gauge-to-gauge differential of 0.3-0.45 psi. Exponent relied upon this information, as well as the fact that during the testing the Non-Logo Gauge never produced a reading higher than the Logo Gauge, to conclude that Walt Anderson most likely used the Non-Logo Gauge to inspect the game balls prior to the game. In other words, they think Anderson used the Non-Logo Gauge (despite the fact that he actually claims otherwise) only because the Non-Logo Gauge produced lower pressure readings . That the conclusion of the report supports some nefarious deflation plot shouldn't be surprising when you pick the result that best supports this belief simply because it best supports this belief. But, what if, what if? , this all started because of NFL officials' gross misunderstanding of thermodynamics? What if, by the time cooler heads with a high school science education had the time to interpret the halftime pressure readings, there had already been several leaks from the NFL office to the media about the Patriots involvement in a cheating scandal? What if, just to keep themselves from looking bad, the NFL had to hire a scientific consulting firm that admits to producing results that the client wants to hear? What if nothing actually happened to the pressure levels of the Patriots footballs during the AFC Championship Game, but despite this fact, the most draconian punishment in the history of the NFL was handed down nonetheless? If this were true, even a Colts fan would have to admit that's pretty messed up. So now, let me get to what the data actually says about the Patriots game balls and make the claim that without even having to appeal to any other wizardy than the fact that it was cold outside and Walt Anderson used the Logo Gauge pre-game (as he thinks he did), the results of the Wells Report support the fact that it is more probable than not that the Patriots game balls weren't even tampered with in the AFC Championship Game. Scientific Results Anderson believes, but did not record, that the Patriots game balls measured 12.5 psig prior to the game. He also believes, but did not record, that he used the Logo Gauge to make these measurements. The former belief is held as gospel truth by the Wells Report. The latter is discarded in favor of the more conspiratorial answer. It would also have been super useful if he'd recorded the temperature of the room pre-game when the measurements were made. Saying that the footballs measured 12.5 psig pre-game isn't exactly useful unless I know the temperature at which this measurement was made. I'm going to suppose 74°F for room temperature. Exponent claims all sorts of temperatures, most of which seem reasonable, but they are all guesses because it was not measured. So, what were the halftime measurements that were compared to the pre-game 12.5 psig at 74°F? Well, it depends on which gauge you ask. Patriots Ball Number Logo Gauge [psig] Non-Logo Gauge [psig] 1 11.80 11.50 2 11.20 11.85 3 11.50 11.15 4 11.00 10.70 5 11.45 11.10 6 11.95 11.60 7 12.30 11.85 8 11.55 11.10 9 11.35 10.95 10 10.90 10.50 11 11.35 10.90 Raw halftime pressure readings provided by the Wells Report. If the Logo Gauge was used pre-game, then the Logo Gauge results from halftime should be used as the comparable results. Since the Non-Logo Gauge measures consistently 0.38 psig lower than the Logo Gauge, we can still use the Non-Logo Gauge results to compare to a 12.5 psig pre-game reading by the Logo Gauge provided that we correct them higher by 0.38 psig . To use halftime results from a pressure gauge not used for the pre-game results is as valid as me using the tire gauge in my glove compartment in the same experiment. Why is it even a valid solution that is considered? Patriots Ball Number Logo Gauge [psig] Non-Logo Gauge (corrected) [psig] 1 11.80 11.88 2 11.20 11.23 3 11.50 11.53 4 11.00 11.08 5 11.45 11.48 6 11.95 11.98 7 12.30 12.23 8 11.55 11.48 9 11.35 11.33 10 10.90 10.88 11 11.35 11.28 Corrected halftime pressure readings, assuming the Logo Gauge was used for pre-game measurements. Due to the cooling of the air inside the footballs which occurred throughout the first half (I'll use 48°F for the halftime ball air temperature, which is what Exponent used), we can use the Ideal Gas Law $$PV = nRT$$ to determine how the pressure of the footballs changed. In this equation, \\(P\\) is pressure in psia (add 14.7 psig to the gauge pressure reading), \\(T\\) is temperature in Kelvin (where Kelvin and Fahrenheit are related by \\(T_K = \\frac{5}{9} (T_F + 459.67)\\) ), \\(V\\) is the volume of the football, \\(n\\) is the amount of air in the football, and \\(R\\) is a universal constant. In the world where \\(V\\) , \\(n\\) , and \\(R\\) are constant (the football doesn't expand and air doesn't leak out, by nefarious means or otherwise), comparing the pre-game readings to the halftime readings is as simple as solving $$\\frac{P_\\mathrm{pregame}}{T_\\mathrm{pregame}} = \\frac{P_\\mathrm{halftime}}{T_\\mathrm{halftime}}$$ Using this equation with \\(T_\\mathrm{pregame}\\) = 74°F and \\(T_\\mathrm{halftime}\\) = 48°F, the halftime measurements of each football can be used to predict what the pre-game pressure value must have been. Before the data was released (and making assumptions about the initial pressure of the Colts balls and the temperatures, which is why the lines are labeled with non-Wells Report numbers -- but you get the idea), I made the following chart which shows just exactly how the pressure of a football should vary with temperature. The pressure response of footballs of various pressures measured at specific temperatures, according to the Ideal Gas Law. But, now that I can use the actual values given in the Wells Report, I got even more precise with these numbers. The calculations for what follows can be found in this spreadsheet . Patriots Ball Number Average Halftime Reading (w/ Non-Logo Gauge corrected) [psig] Projected Pre-Game Reading on Logo Gauge [psig] 1 11.84 13.20 2 11.22 12.54 3 11.52 12.86 4 11.04 12.36 5 11.47 12.81 6 11.97 13.33 7 12.27 13.65 8 11.52 12.86 9 11.34 12.67 10 10.89 12.20 11 11.32 12.65 Average 11.49 12.83 Projected pre-game pressure readings on the Logo Gauge, assuming the Logo Gauge was used for pre-game measurements. Half-time ball temperature 48°F. Pre-game ball temperature 74°F. Why, that data almost suggests that nothing nefarious happened at all! The average halftime measurement was 11.49 psig in Logo Gauge units. This corresponds to a pre-game projected measurement on the Logo Gauge of 12.83 psig. I'm pretty sure that's greater than 12.5 psig, which is the arbitrary limit the NFL set. In fact, only 2 balls were projected to be lower than 12.5 psig (balls 4 and 10), which can be explained in a bazillion ways other than cheating (and according to Occam's razor , those other solutions are probably more realistic). But, in this scenario (with constant halftime temperature of 48°F), the Colts balls would have initially been 14.13 psig. That doesn't seem right. So, to be a bit more fair, a simple solution to the heat equation predicts that the temperature of the air within the footballs begins to move towards equilibrium with the indoor temperature in an exponential fashion, eventually asymptotically approaching room temperature. If Exponent is to be believed (and why not!), this process takes place in a period of approximately 15 minutes (according to Figure 14 on page 31 of the Exponent section). image by Exponent from the Wells Report Keeping in mind that a total of 13.5 minutes was available to measure each of the 11 Patriots balls and 4 Colts balls and to refill the Patriots balls, I fit each measurement along this curve over time (so each subsequent football is a bit warmer than the last). The Patriots footballs took about 5 minutes to be measured, so they're about 58°F by the end of measurement. This was an inexact science, but probably pretty darn good, according to the plot above. Patriots Ball Number Average Halftime Reading (w/ Non-Logo Gauge corrected) [psig] Projected Pre-Game Reading on Logo Gauge [psig] 1 11.84 13.20 2 11.22 12.49 3 11.52 12.75 4 11.04 12.20 5 11.47 12.59 6 11.97 13.06 7 12.27 13.31 8 11.52 12.48 9 11.34 12.25 10 10.89 11.73 11 11.32 12.12 Average 11.49 12.56 Projected pre-game pressure readings on the Logo Gauge, assuming the Logo Gauge was used for pre-game measurements. Half-time ball temperature 48°F and heating towards room temperature, ending at 58°F. Pre-game ball temperature 74°F. In this case, four balls were under 12.5 psig (balls 4, 9, 10, and 11), but the average was still 12.56 psig, which is still greater than 12.5 psig. Given the number of variables that could be changing, this is completely reasonable to any fair reader of the report. In this scenario, there are two possibilities for when the Colts balls are measured during halftime (I discuss this at the bottom in the Various Notes of Note section) -- either right after the Patriots balls were or at the end of halftime, after refilling the Patriots balls. If they were measured right after the Patriots balls, the Colts balls were on average 13.43 psig originally (conflicting with what Anderson said they were). But, if they were measured at the end of halftime (when their temperature was nearly 70°F), they would have been 13.01 psig. This is exactly what Anderson said they were. So, a scenario where the Logo Gauge was used by Walt Anderson pre-game, the Patriots halftime measurements were recorded at the beginning of halftime, and the Colts were measured at the end of halftime yields an average initial pressure of 12.56 psig for the Patriots balls and 13.01 psig for the Colts ball. Both are what Anderson measured pregame without tampering having to be invoked. And now, a quick aside to discuss the halftime timeline. I've received numerous emails asking me to include something about the post-game pressure readings, something Exponent conveniently decided was not valid for the narrative. The people have spoken, and they are right -- there is much to be gained from doing so. After the game was over, a set of four Patriots balls and four Colts balls were randomly chosen and pressure sampled. Using these readings and the in-no-way-tampered-with actual pressures of those footballs (all of which were nominally set at 13.0 psig, either by the Colts initially or by the officials at halftime, in the case of the Patriots footballs), we can infer something about the order of events at halftime. Assuming all the post-game footballs had reached an equilibrium temperature (let's say 74°F, it turns out not to matter so much for the argument) and that the footballs were representative of the entire sample, what temperature did the a) halftime Colts balls' temperature have to be in order for the post-game and halftime measurements to agree? and b) what was the temperature of the Patriots footballs at the time they were refilled by the officials to 13.0 psig? For instance, we know that the Patriots footballs had to have been inflated at halftime while they were still cool, otherwise the balls would have reached 13.0 psig equilibrium post-game. Instead they reached pressures exceeding 13.0 psig, definitively showing they were refilled before reaching equilibrium. Some quick calculations suggest, relative to a 74°F post-game measurement, these balls had to be refilled at between 62°F and 68°F to 13.0 psig for the pressure to rise to the post-game levels at 74°F. But, the Colts balls would have to have been measured at halftime at temperatures between 72°F and 75°F in order for the post-game and halftime measurements to coincide. I'd say it's close to completely evident that the halftime order of events was 1) check Patriots balls, 2) refill Patriots balls, 3) check Colts balls. And, if this is the case, the Colts measurements at halftime were at temperatures very near room temperature and the Patriots measurements at halftime were at temperatures much closer to the outside conditions. Therefore, it is both obvious and necessary for the Patriots balls to see a larger pressure differential than the Colts balls, and it is both obvious and necessary for the Patriots readings to have a higher variance. See the 'Various Notes of Note' section below for further discussion. But, no no no. These results won't do. So, Anderson must have used the Non-Logo Gauge. Well, fine. Here's the worst-case scenario, which does look awfully bad. I'd bet that's why it was chosen as the scenario \"more likely than not.\" Patriots Ball Number Average Halftime Reading (w/ Logo Gauge corrected) [psig] Projected Pre-Game Reading on Non-Logo Gauge [psig] 1 11.46 12.80 2 10.84 12.09 3 11.14 12.35 4 10.66 11.80 5 11.09 12.19 6 11.86 12.66 7 11.89 12.92 8 11.14 12.09 9 10.96 11.86 10 10.51 11.34 11 10.94 11.73 Average 11.11 12.17 Projected pre-game pressure readings on the Non-Logo Gauge, assuming the Non-Logo Gauge was used for pre-game measurements. Half-time ball temperature 48°F and heating towards room temperature, ending at 58°F. Pre-game ball temperature 74°F. Yup. See. Cheatriots. I knew it all along! 8 of the 11 balls were under the allowable limit! The average was only 12.17 psig. Someone let the air out. I'll bet Tom Brady knew about it. In this scenario, if the Colts balls were measured immediately after the Patriots balls, they'd have an average of 13.04 psig. This is, I think, why Exponent chose this scenario. I don't know why they didn't consider that the Colts balls were measured later in halftime. In that case, they'd have an average of 12.62 psig, which doesn't match what Anderson originally reported. Of course, this scenario is only acceptable if you assume Anderson perfectly remembered what the pre-game pressure measurements were, but failed to recall which pressure gauge he used to make these measurements. Why this scenario was chosen seems a bit too obvious and evil, even for Roger Goodell. Why is the bolded one above not more logical? Finally, just to complete the circle, if the Logo Gauge was the gauge used for the pre-game measurements and we assume the average halftime pressure measurement of 11.5 psig for the Patriots balls, what pre-game and halftime temperatures would the balls have to be in order to produce a pre-game value of 12.5 psig or higher? I produced a heatmap ( you can see my work in producing this here ) showing the phase space for the pre-game and halftime temperatures that suggest no tampering took place. For instance, if you think the halftime ball temperature was 55°F for a 11.5 psig reading (find 55°F on the x-axis), then the pre-game temperature would have to be about 72°F or higher for the initial pressure to have been 12.5 psig or higher (all the values on the y-axis that are white or red along the vertical about 55°F on the x-axis). Heatmap showing the predicted pre-game measured pressure for an 11.5 psig (at halftime) football, for all pre-game and halftime temperature possibilities. For a given pre-game and halftime temperature, the pre-game football measurement is 12.5 psig or higher if the color is white or red. It is below 12.5 psig in all phase space that is blue. Concluding Thoughts So, here we are. A legendary quarterback and the GOAT accused of cheating and suspended for 4 games (at a personal cost of 2 million dollars and a tarnished legacy). A flagship franchise stripped of 2 draft picks and fined 1 million dollars despite the fact that the Wells Report cleared them of responsibility. Two low-level employees all-but-fired. All because of a report that suggests that air wasn't even let out of the footballs, unless you choose to find a way to twist the math. To assign the level of scientific integrity that has been assigned to this study, I'd expect to have the pre-game measurements carefully recorded, along with the room temperature at the time of the recording. I'd also really expect for you to know which gauge you used to make this measurement. All other pressure measurements should only be made with gauges that are calibrated to the original pressure gauge. It'd be nice to know what the atmospheric pressure was at all times too. And the relative humidity. I know Exponent did their best to try to determine what these all probably were, but we don't know what they actually were at the times in question. For example, the room in which the balls were checked pre-game could have been 70°F normally, but what about if there are a dozen officials in the room? There are just so many factors that could be in play that change all of this, knowing solid numbers for everything that would affect these measurements is extremely important to the science. None of this recording happened. And we are to assign a level of certainty to this process that passes scientific scrutiny? I'd bet even Bill Nye would agree that this is all a bit absurd. So, you win, NFL. You win. It's been a wonderful 22 years. 1 psig is unit of pressure. It stands for \"pounds per square inch gauge.\" This is what a pressure gauge records. It is different from psia, which stands for \"pounds per square inch absolute,\" by the value of the atmospheric pressure containing both the object being measured and the gauge. Usually (although conspicuously not recorded in this \"scientific\" investigation), atmospheric pressure is 14.7 psia. So, a gauge reading of 12.5 psig actually represents an internal pressure of (12.5 + 14.7 =) 27.2 psia. Various Notes of Note: Why did the Colts ball lose less pressure and have less variability? Do you think this scenario is likely? The Patriots balls were immediately checked at halftime. Found to be below 12.5 psig, they were then refilled to get them to proper levels. After checking the Patriots balls and refilling them, the Colts balls were then checked. The officials could only get to 4 Colts balls before running out of time. This is the only order of events that makes sense. The officials wouldn't have checked only 4 of the Colts balls if they checked them before refilling the Patriots balls. They would have checked all 12 Colts balls and then run out of time refilling the Patriots balls. Right? So, if the order of events was check Patriots, refill Patriots, check Colts, and given that the temperature was increasing but asymptotically approaching room temperature, the Colts balls were checked at significantly higher and steadier temperatures than the Patriots balls. They were higher because they were taken later, with more time for the temperature to reequilibrate. They were steadier because they were taken closer to the asymptote, where minute-by-minute temperature changes were less steep. If this is true, then two things would also be true of the Colts balls relative to the Patriots balls: 1. The pressure readings of the Colts balls would be much closer to their original pre-game measurements than the Patriots balls would be. 2. The variation in the pressure readings of the Colts balls would be smaller than the variation in the Patriots balls because there is less rapid temperature changes and a more steady-state environment internally. This latter point can be restated: if there is a trend in the data over time, then before we start calculating standard deviations from the mean, we must first detrend the data . Obviously, the variability of 11 measurements is higher than the variability of 4 measurements if the underlying thing being measured is changing over time, which the pressure clearly is -- the temperature is slowly ramping towards room temperature. The pressure readings of footballs over time when temperature is slowly ramping. The variability of the measurements compared to the mean is obviously higher for the larger data set measured over the longer time. This plot is with pressure readings sorted by increasing pressure, not by ball number as reported in the Wells Report. If ball number is a stand-in for time, the scatter is more random around the mean, not increasing as in the sorted measurements. This plot is only to illustrate the point that if temperature is changing throughout the measurements, then comparing each measurement to a flat mean (which assumes no change is fundamentally going on in the thing being measured) would naturally lead to a large variance. Consider yourself warned on this plot. How was this not considered when citing those two specific pieces as evidence against the Patriots? What about those text messages? I'll admit, the text messages are weird. Keep in mind, they're from months before the game in question and don't clearly say anything about illegally deflating footballs. Sure, Jim McNally calls himself the \"deflator.\" But consider the following: Person 1: Hey killer, how's it going!? Person 2: Good man, good. Killer. Cool nickname. Steve: Hey guys! Person 2: Hey man. ::Steve wanders away.:: Police: Person 2, you're under arrest for the murder of Steve! Person 2: What? ::Steve wanders back.:: Person 2: But Steve's right here. He's not even dead. Police: Oh yeah? Well then why the nickname 'killer?' Likely story, killer. Guilty. Scene Yes, this is ridiculous. But, you'd have to admit if no crime actually occurred and the balls were not, in fact, deflated in the AFC Championship Game, then any text messages referring to a nickname seem a little arbitrary to build a punishment upon. Look, I'm not saying definitely that the Patriots weren't involved in some sort of ball deflation scheme. I'm just saying, so far, I've seen no actual evidence that it occurred in the one and only game in which they checked. if (!document.getElementById('mathjaxscript_pelican_#%@#$@#')) { var align = \"left\", indent = \"2em\", linebreak = \"false\"; if (false) { align = (screen.width < 768) ? \"left\" : align; indent = (screen.width < 768) ? \"0em\" : indent; linebreak = (screen.width < 768) ?

I am a life-long New England Patriots fan. You could probably assume that because there is no other reason I would put the time into this analysis that I have. On the other hand, I definitely value good statistical analyses leading to well-founded conclusions that elucidate difficult concepts for people instead of adding more confusion. And the confusion and jumping-to-conclusions-with-no-actual-information with this entire Deflategate mess (PSI: New England is the far superior name) is something that doesn't need a thorough statistical analysis pointing people in the wrong direction. But this is what has happened. People claim \"numbers don't lie\" as an end-all to arguments and point to (among others on his blog) Warren Sharp's very detailed analysis of Patriot fumble rates . Well, I can assure you: numbers are very easy to manipulate. Summary I claim that not only are the New England Patriots not an impossible outlier in fumble efficiency, they're not an outlier at all. I can show this simply by exactly recreating Sharp's analysis but correcting for merely one omission from the data set: instead of eliminating all dome teams from the sample set, only remove games played indoors. I will also highlight the choice of what I believe to be a biased an unfair comparison metric (the 5-year rolling average in plays per fumble), the use of which still only looks like damning evidence if dome teams are removed from the analysis. I will also attempt to calculate the actual probability of the Patriots having this current run of success in fumble efficiency, although admittedly my calculation is not perfect. It's a physicist's approximation. Finally, I will argue that while the Patriots did drastically improve in fumble efficiency in 2007 and following, without the prior assumption of guilt in cheating, there are numerable other explanations for this team to improve. Also, an apology off the bat: I don't know Warren Sharp. I don't know his motivation behind this analysis. And, maybe I'm being a bit too defensive of my football team (I'm certainly not going to say that they're innocent yet, although I have theories -- more on that in a later post). But, I have very real concerns with the large number of assumptions and convenient omissions from his analysis that make me feel compelled to issue commentary. This analysis has gone extremely viral (an honestly non-sarcastic kudos to you, Warren!) with no one seriously questioning it. Take this for what it's worth. I mean no offense, Warren, and I welcome your response. Update: Other Fantastic Articles in This Space There has been a lot of chatter on this topic in the statisticians blogosphere.

Matthews and Michael Lopez -- follow Michael @StatsbyLopez and Gregory @StatsInTheWild ShoutingLoudly's look at the statistical significance of the player-by-player fumble rate while on Patriots vs. on other teams, by Bill Herman -- follow him @shoutingloudly My friend Tom Hayden's take on the normality assumption used in calculating the likelihood -- follow him @haydenth Data Set Description My friend and former GrubHub colleague Tom Hayden shared with me a database of season-by-season, team-by-team fumble and play count data scraped from NFL.com , grouped not only by team and season, but also by games played indoors, outdoors, and in a retractable roof stadium. I am considering total fumbles in this analysis, not fumbles lost , because a) I want more data to lead to better accuracy and b) I simply refuse to believe that fumble recovery rates (analagous to a coin flip) are affected for one team over another because of a 10% psi difference. For simplicity (and for obvious reasons), I'm going to be considering only games that are played outdoors. This is something Warren Sharp attempts, but for some reason chooses the route of throwing out all games played by dome teams, not just ones indoors. The data can be found here . Analysis And now, for the analysis. Challenged Assumption #1: Don't throw out dome teams You can throw out games played indoors, I am fine with that. It makes a ton of sense (although something interesting I found: fumble rates were actually higher indoors than outdoors -- go figure!). But please, the extra work must be done to preserve the games played by dome teams outdoors. I cannot stress this enough: there is no reason to remove dome teams from this analysis, there is only reason to remove games played indoors. There are a few reasons: It makes no sense to (e.g.) include a game played between the Falcons and Patriots in New England (outdoors) in the analysis for the Patriots but not include the exact same game for the Falcons. Throwing out all dome teams does exactly this. Two of the greatest quarterbacks of this generation have played significant time as part of a dome team (Peyton Manning and Drew Brees). To take those offenses out of consideration and comparison with the Patriots is unfair. It turns out that -- and I definitely don't know why -- teams that play in domes tend to have fantastic fumble stats when playing outdoors. Eliminating these from the data set obviously makes the Patriots look really, really bad because you just eliminated most of their real competition for fumble efficiency, whether intentionally or not. Challenged Assumption #2: Don't cherry pick a 5-year rolling average I have no non-conspiracy theory idea why Warren Sharp decided to use the 5-year rolling average rate of plays per fumble instead of, say, a 2-year rolling average, or simply a year-by-year look. But I can tell you this, the Patriots total league rank each year in plays per fumble (outdoors only) looks like this (apologies for not having 2001 in this set!): Season Rate (plays / fumble) Rank 2014 78.3 2nd 2013 46.8 21st 2012 85.1 3rd 2011 83.2 2nd 2010 103.7 1st 2009 79.5 2nd 2008 64.3 5th 2007 71.1 2nd 2006 41.4 19th 2005 51.2 10th 2004 42.1 18th 2003 46.8 10th 2002 40.1 14th Okay, fine. One conspiracy theory: the 5-year rolling average was chosen because 1 year doesn't look bad (they were only 1st ONCE in the last 13 years!), you can't use a 2- or 3-year rolling average because that 2013 is going to bring your average way down (see below). And you might as well get that stellar 2010 season in there to make it look, as Warren Sharp would say, IMPOSSIBLE. If intentional, this is called cherry picking, and it's a huge no-no in the world of analysis. It's a way to make numbers lie. What I see is an incredibly good, incredibly consistent team. I don't see a perfectly consistent team, because they sucked last year (and no, you can't just say 2013 doesn't count because of the 6 fumble Broncos game because you would then need to remove all bad games by all teams before making a comparison -- play fair!). Also, I don't see a team that even necessarily stands out as being an outlier, let alone an impossible one. Take a look at the actual data going into the 5-year rolling average calculation. In all seasons by all teams since 2010, the Patriots (while incredible good at not fumbling each year) have only accounted for 1 of the top 7 team-seasons in terms of plays per fumble. There is simply no way you can make the claim that their ability to hold onto the football is impossible if you actually show a fair and transparent data set. In Sharp's analysis, after removing all dome teams from the comparison set, and by choice of the 5-year rolling average in plays per fumble as the comparison metric, he comes up with the following, incredible scandalous looking plot. image by Warren Sharp However, by reintroducing dome teams and only eliminating those games played indoors, the exact same plot looks like this: And, just to highlight the absurdity of choosing a 5-year rolling average over any other season spread containing the 2014 season: An aside that I simply cannot resist: what is the deal with the 2014 Minnesota Vikings!? If deflated footballs are the cause of all the success the Patriots have had in fumble efficiency since 2007, then why does the one team that has been caught tampering with footballs post-inspection stand out as such an impossible outlier this season, especially since they were caught heating footballs, which would cause the ball to artificially inflate ? And no, I don't really think the Vikings were cheating in warming up their footballs; and no, I don't really think the Vikings fumble efficiency success this season had anything to do with football air pressure. What is clear in all this: Even choosing the 5-year rolling average, the Patriots are not a statistical outlier, they are simply on the high end of excellence in the league. They're not even the best. It's pretty clear that while the Patriots have been very consistent and therefore near the top of the league in this statistic for years, choosing any other comparison set than the 5-year rolling average makes the Patriots look worse that what was portrayed in Sharp's analysis. Challenged Assumption #3: Don't say this can only occur once in 16,233.77 instances First of all, the data scientist quoted for this statistic says, \"Based on the assumption that fumbles per play follow a normal distribution.\" Other than simply looking at the histogram above and realizing that this doesn't look altogether normal, I'm not going to go into why this is a faulty assumption. Besides, my friend Tom has already made this point (even throwing out all dome teams!). Without this assumption, it is difficult to make precise calculations of the rarity of the Patriots success, even assuming everything that allows Warren Sharp to produce the extremely damning-looking data set above. And another thing: the \"once in 16,233.77 instances\" statistic is assuming that fumbles occur \"according to random fluctuation.\" This is not only an absurd assumption (player skill and offensive scheme definitely contribute), it's been shown statistically that only about half of all turnovers (fumbles included) are due to luck and not skill/scheme . As a quick exercise to come up with my own calculation in how likely this outcome is, I make the claim that in order for the Patriots to appear in the position they do in the 5-year rolling average of plays per fumble, all they need to do is finish in the Top 3 in the league in 4 out of the 5 seasons involved. If the odds of the Patriots finishing in the Top 3 any given season is a constant a , then the probability of finishing in the Top 3 in 4 out of 5 years is given by $$p = a&#94;5 + 5 a&#94;4 (1 - a)$$ This comes from the fact that 5 out of 5 years is a success (with probability \\(a&#94;5\\) ) and 4 out of 5 years is a success (with probability \\(a&#94;4 (1-a)\\) ). The latter has 5 ways of happening: for example, the failed year could be 2014 or 2013 or 2012 or 2011 or 2010. In a world where fumbles are solely driven by random fluctation (a world we don't live in, but still), the Patriots will finish in the Top 3 with a probability \\(a = 3/32\\) . Plugging into the equation above, this results in an outcome at least as successful as the Patriots outcome would occur only 0.04% of the time, or once in 2,800 instances. On the other hand, assuming there's not some nefarious reason for the Patriots to appear this frequently in the Top 3 over the years, we actually do have a sample that helps us understand the Patriots probability of appearing in the Top 3 in 4 of 5 years: their historical frequency of ranking in the Top 3. There are many season sample sizes I can choose to come up with the single-season probability a . Do I only include the current Patriots scheme, and thus only post-2007 data ( \\(a = 6/8\\) )? Do I include all data from the Brady/Belichick era since 2002 ( \\(a = 6/13\\) )? Do I use either of these two numbers divided by 2, since luck plays a 50% role on average ( \\(a = 6/16\\) or \\(a = 6/26\\) )? Using each of these assumption in turn, I find that the probability of that Patriots having a similar or better stretch of success over a 5-year period is far from impossible. Single-Season Probability \\(a\\) Probability of 4 out of 5 having successful seasons \\(p = a&#94;5 + 5 a&#94;4 (1 - a)\\) Rate of Occurence \\(1/p\\) 3/32 0.04% once in 2,800 instances 6/8 63.3% twice out of 3 instances 6/13 14.3% once in 7 instances 6/16 6.92% once in 14 instances 6/26 1.16% once in 86 instances Again, these calculations are completely illustrative. They aren't the most precise, but they certainly help paint a picture. If you must assume that all fumbles are completely random and the Patriots are most likely to finish 16th next season once they can no longer \"cheat,\" then I'll admit that it would be damn difficult to get a similar stretch of success (once in 2,800 instances). But if this team is simply good and exceptionally efficient in holding onto the football, then it's actually incredibly likely for this to have happened -- probable, in fact. Keep in mind that if once in 14 instances were the right frequency, then two similarly talented teams would be expected to perform this well in the league in any 5-year span. Challenged Assumption #4: Don't assign scheme improvements to cheating Now, let me return to the per-season plays per fumble numbers for the Patriots. Season Rate (plays / fumble) Rank 2014 78.3 2nd 2013 46.8 21st 2012 85.1 3rd 2011 83.2 2nd 2010 103.7 1st 2009 79.5 2nd 2008 64.3 5th 2007 71.1 2nd 2006 41.4 19th 2005 51.2 10th 2004 42.1 18th 2003 46.8 10th 2002 40.1 14th Another glaringly obvious trend in this data is that, yes, the Patriots got way better starting in 2007. If you want to assign this meaning because this was the year that the ball rule went into effect, go ahead. Conspiracy theories are hard to contest when there is an incredibly intertwined set of causes. Do lizard people secretly run our government? PROVE THAT THEY DON'T. Anyhow, might I also suggest the following plausible explanations for drastic improvement? Consider 2006: Reche Caldwell, Doug Gabriel. Now consider 2007: Randy Moss, Wes Welker. Same in 2008. You eventually get Rob Gronkowski, Julian Edelman, et cetera. Please don't make me compare Reche, Ben Watson, and Troy Brown (LOVE YOU, TROY!) to Gronk and Welker. The pre-2006 Patriots ran a completely different offensive set than the post-2007 Patriots. Remember the 2007 Patriots? The greatest offense ever assembled? They were the first Patriots spread offense. They still use that today. Tom Brady is simply better now. I remember watching Brady dink high passes off of receivers on crossing routes leading to tipped interceptions. I remember him being in the pocket too long. I now see him getting rid of the ball at nearly the fastest pace in the game. I see him intentionally throwing the ball at the feet of receivers in traffic and on crossing routes causing them to catch the pass on the way to the turf (thus not allowing fumbles on tackles). And why were they much more pedestrian in 2008 while still having the greatest offensive skill players in the league? Could it have had something to do with Bernard Pollard and Matt Cassel? Before jumping to conclusions that a ball that is underinflated by 10% at most can somehow halve the rate of fumble occurence, I simply ask that you first consider the far more likely scenarios. Conspiracy theories are fun and incredibly hard to refute, but that doesn't make them the most plausible explanation. Conclusion I hope that you've seen that not only are the Patriots not IMPOSSIBLE outliers in the rate of plays per fumble, but their observed success in this metric is actually expected by at least a couple of teams every season. In fact, the Patriots don't even lead the league in the rate of plays per fumble by any metric I could find, assuming of course that you don't simply eliminate dome teams from the calculation (and only limit the calculation to games played outdoors). In short, and I am very confident when I say this, there has not been a single statistically accurate statement made that any underinflation of footballs by the New England Patriots has any impact on the game . This does not mean that if they did intentionally deflate footballs, in a way that is against the rules as stated, they should not be punished. This is simply my attempt to quell the rising insurgence of pitchfork-wielding Patriots-haters asking for Bill Belichick's firing and that they should not be allowed the play in the Superbowl. Why don't we all give this absurd story a little time to breathe, allow a few confirmed facts to be established, and then go about the business of providing proof that the Patriots violated league rules. This team is not a team of cheaters, as far as I can tell.
