<center>![The Fustin Family, May 2015](/images/about/family.jpg)</center>

I'm a resident of Chicago's [West Loop](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_West_Side,_Chicago#West_Loop) neighborhood, having lived in the city since 2004.

I came here to attend a PhD program in the [Department of Physics](http://physics.uchicago.edu/) at the [University of Chicago](http://uchicago.edu). There, I worked with the [COUPP collaboration](http://www-coupp.fnal.gov/) on a dark matter direct detection experiment, looking for signals of WIMP-nucleon scattering in a superheated CF<sub>3</sub>I bubble chamber located at [SNOLAB](http://www.snolab.ca/), in an active nickel mine over a mile underground in Canada. As you do.

I'm the Lead Data Scientist at [SpotHero](http://www.spothero.com/), an on-demand solution to help drivers find their perfect parking spot, reserved ahead of time often at rates much lower than you'd find if you just drove up to the garage. What's not to love?

Prior to this, I was a Data Scientist at [Digital H2O](http://www.digitalh2o.com/), a Chicago-based SaaS startup focusing on providing descriptive and predictive water intelligence for the oil and gas industry, and also the Insights Analyst with [GrubHub](https://www.grubhub.com/), where I helped to turn food facts into media content for the Public Relations/Marketing Department and transform diner and restaurant data into actionable initiatives/products within the organization.

In my short time in tech, I've been a part of a merger between two billion dollar companies, a very successful IPO, and a startup funding round and eventual acquisition.

I live with my wife Alexis and daughter June. I love spending time with my family, working on random data projects, football (Go [Patriots](http://www.patriots.com/) and [Buckeyes](http://www.ohiostatebuckeyes.com/sports/m-footbl/osu-m-footbl-body.html)!), and making a good cocktail.
